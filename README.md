# HTML CSS Capstone project

This project has 3 pages, namely: home page, search page, and show page. It is completely responsive and targets 3 breakpoints. This project also utilizes utility classes heavily such as `mt-3`, `flex`, instead of specific classes like `navigation`, `footer`, `accordion` etc, for their reusability purposes.

All the `.scss` files have been segmentized into directories depending on their `action`. For example: `margin` and `padding` classes go inside the `utility` directory and more generic classes such as the `btn` go inside the `components` directory. The componentization method has been adopted to avoid specificity issues and for ease of `import`ing the files.
